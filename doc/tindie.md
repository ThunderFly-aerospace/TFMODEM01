# What is it?

TFMODEM01 is an advanced telemetry transceiver for use in a GCS (Ground control station). TFMODEM supports multiple antenna connection two is standard and could be expanded up to four Tx/Rx antennas. The modem automatically selects the most suitable receiving and transmitting antenna, according to the best connection quality. The modem can use concurrently both an omnidirectional antenna and a high-gain directional antenna on a rotator that provides a high-reliable connection to distant flights.

The TFMODEM01 is compatible with standard SiK-based UAV and UAS infrastructure. Therefore it could be directly used with Ground Control software like [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/).

The receiver is packed in an aluminum box.
