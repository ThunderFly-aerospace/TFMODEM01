# TFMODEM01A -  ThunderFly ground SiK radio telemetry system

The modem is part of the ThunderFly ground control station. It is based on our port of widely-used [SiK firmware](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/SiK), which is ported to upgraded Si1060 SiliconLabs chip. Although this new chip supports new features, the TFMODEM is backward compatible with older SiK devices.
